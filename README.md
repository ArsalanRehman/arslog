### *Because future-you deserves fewer headaches.*

Welcome to **arslog** — a personal archive of the problems Arsalan faced, fought, and finally defeated after hours of googling, debugging, and whispering threats to his computer.

This repo serves as a **living logbook** of “Oh… THAT’S how I fixed it” moments.
Whenever something breaks (and it *will*), arslog is where the truth is written.

## ⚔️ **Why arslog exists**

Because relying on memory is a trap.
Because future-you will forget.
Because the Universe demands documentation.

And because every time Arsalan solves something cool and doesn’t write it down, a bug is born.
